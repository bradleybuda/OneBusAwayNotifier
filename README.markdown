OneBusAway Notifier
===================

A simple OSX app for browsing OneBusAway and letting you know when
interesting busses are on their way.

This is a work in progress and almost certainly won't work for you in
its current state.

TODO
----

* Configure which route(s) to notify on
* Configure which stops(s) to notify on
* Notification frequency - how soon ahead?
* Whitelist / blacklist notification periods
* Nice stop / route browser
* Start at system startup
* Package / Install / Update
